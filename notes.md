I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

    humanYears are whole numbers only

    15 cat years for first year
    +9 cat years for second year
    +4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years

    15 dog years for first year
    +9 dog years for second year
